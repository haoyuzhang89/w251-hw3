# w251-hw3
Some more help for hw3.  We'll run through the following examples in order:

- camera
- mosquitto
- pubsub
- streaming
- nxToServer
- nxFaceDetection

Sections starting with `nx` will be run on your nx.  The other sections will be run on a machine on the same network as your nx.  This machine needs docker and pthon3 installed.
