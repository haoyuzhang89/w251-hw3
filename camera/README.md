`cam.py` is a simple test application.  It uses openCV and Numby to read from your camera, convert the image to gray, then display it.  It requies both numby and openCV be installed.

As needed, run:
`pip3 install numpy`
and (not required on the NX):
`pip3 install opencv-python`

Once installed, run:
```
python3 cam.py
```

At this point, you have a working camera example!
